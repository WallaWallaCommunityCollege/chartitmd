    I added a index that serves as a template for each of the pages. it
    inclues and patient IDbar and a nave bar. I have also added an animated
    nave bar that may prove to be useless but maybe we could make it into a
    context senstive menu bar on the right?

    I added a Db connection file that need to be edit to make the page work.
	I tis currently set to my local host and must be edited

    I made an Icon for the app // page

    I added a patient class  we need to use this not just data each time the
    page loads.
